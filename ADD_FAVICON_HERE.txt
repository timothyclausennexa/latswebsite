IMPORTANT: To add your brain logo favicon:

1. Take the brain logo image you showed me
2. Save it as ONE of these names in the 'public' folder:
   - favicon.png (recommended)
   - favicon.ico (if you convert it to ICO format)

The file should be saved at:
C:\Users\timot\Downloads\latswebsite\public\favicon.png

OR you can use an online converter:
1. Go to https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/
2. Upload your brain logo image
3. Download the generated files
4. Put favicon.ico in the public folder

After adding the file, refresh your browser with Ctrl+F5
