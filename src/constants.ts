    { question: "What the hell is this?", answer: "It's a live social experiment. SLURP is bound to a 24/7 entertainment livestream. The community controls the length of his 'sentence' by buying and selling the $SLURP token. Buying adds time, selling reduces it. Freedom is when the timer hits zero." },
    { question: "Is this real?", answer: "The timer, the stream, and the tokenomics are 100% real. The consequences are real. This is not a simulation." },
    { question: "What happens when the timer runs out?", answer: "The stream immediately ends. The token's utility (controlling the timer) ceases, and it becomes a relic of the experiment. The only way to win is for the timer to reach zero." },
    { question: "Is this a good investment?", answer: "This is not financial advice. This is a high-risk, high-reward memecoin and social experiment. Its value is derived entirely from community participation and narrative. Participate for the entertainment and the story. Any financial gain is a byproduct of a successful experiment." },
    { question: "What happens at $1B MCAP? Is he free?", answer: "No. Reaching $1B doesn't grant freedomâ€”it triggers Season 2. The game gets harder, but the community's power to fight back increases: sells will remove TRIPLE the amount of time. The only escape is the timer hitting zero." },
    { question: "Is the LP burnt?", answer: "Yes. The liquidity is automatically burnt at launch on pump.fun. This is standard for pump.fun launches and secures the project from the start." },
